## Adding Custom Tools

Custom tools allow you to enhance the functionality of your SWE agents by integrating new capabilities. Adding a custom tool is as simple as writing a new Python function.

### Example: Adding a 'Cow Say' Tool

Here's an example of how to add a custom tool using the `@action` decorator from Composio:
<CodeGroup>
``` python Custom Tool Example
from composio import action

# tool name is "cow"
# requires cowsay library
@action(toolname="cow", requires=["cowsay"])
def say(message: str) -> str:
    """
    cow will say whatever you want it to say.
    :param message: Message string
    :return greeting: Formatted message.
    """
    import cowsay
    return cowsay.get_output_string("cow", message)
```
</CodeGroup>


### Dependency Management

When adding custom tools, ensure that you manage dependencies appropriately. The `requires` parameter allows you to specify any external libraries needed by your tool.

### Integrating Custom Tools

Once you've added your custom tool, you can integrate it into your toolset as follows:

<CodeGroup>
``` python Integrating Custom Tools
from custom_tools import say

from composio import ComposioToolSet

composio_toolset = ComposioToolSet()

tools = [
  *composio_toolset.get_tools(apps=[
      # ... other tools
  ]),
  *composio_toolset.get_tools(
    actions=[
      say, # Your custom tool
  ]
)]
```
</CodeGroup>

### Using Custom Tools in Your Agents

After integrating your custom tools, you can use them directly in your agents' code, enhancing their capabilities and enabling them to perform a wider range of tasks.
