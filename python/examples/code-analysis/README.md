## Introduction
This project is an example which uses Composio to seamlessly analyze your code and provide valuable insights.
It can help developers identify bugs, optimize performance, and maintain best coding practices across their projects.

## ðŸ‘£ Steps to Run
**Navigate to the Project Directory:**
Change to the directory where the `setup.sh`, `main.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `README.md` files are located. For example:
```shell
cd path/to/project/directory
```

### 1. Run the Setup File
Make the setup.sh Script Executable (if necessary):
On Linux or macOS, you might need to make the setup.sh script executable:
```shell
chmod +x setup.sh
```
Execute the setup.sh script to set up the environment, install dependencies, login to composio and 
add necessary tools:
```shell
./setup.sh
```
Now, Fill in the `.env` file with your secrets.

### 2. Run the python script
```shell
python cookbook/examples/code-analysis/main.py
```
